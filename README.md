- 👋 Hi, I’m @aiEverything (MAYANK PARASHAR)
- 👀 I’m interested in ai , robotics and meditative biology
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ai, robotics and meditative biology 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all three of them specially meditative biology (this is a feild of biology that deals with affect of meditaion on human body )

- I have a theory on meditative biology that is human can be trained like neural networks and their training rate is even faster than machines.
- but since they train on every input they take, be it air, water, solid food, light, fire etc.. which results in overall insignifican improvement
- which can be mitigated by constraining on inputs and this is what i want to research on.
